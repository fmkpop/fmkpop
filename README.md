### Todo
- Completely broken on Firefox? wtf?
- ~~refactor into seperate components~~ ✅
- add image fetch retry on fail - fixed? haven't seen this issue in a while
- ~~add fixed image height + scaled images~~ ✅
- ~~nugu purge~~ ✅
- change selection colours to reflect choice
- ~~add bar chart displaying results after voting~~ ✅ - won't do - final stats is good enough
- ~~add next button~~ ✅
- ~~add girls leaderboard~~ ✅
- filter for portrait images only - probably a better solution than scuffed scaling
